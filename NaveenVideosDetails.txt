Java class #7
Method overloading, Static none static class objects, Heap memory, Garbage collector


Java Class #8
constructor, constructor with or without parameters,
if we dont create constructor JVM creates a hidden constructor by default 
when ever we create an object the construtor of that particular class will be called
this.class variable = local variable 




Java Class #9 

incapsolation means we declared some variable private in nature and access them with the help of public methods
// to create getter and setter methos righ click on sourc and select generate getter setter method
class objects

when a parent class and a child class have seprate seprate methods with same name same parameter is called method overriding 
it comes in to the picture at the time to inharitance

method overloding>> with in the same class we create different methods with same name but perametter and numbers are different

method orverloading and method overriding are the concipt of polymarphysenm 
poly means many and marhpsm means forms

polymorphism = method overloading+methodoverriding
method overloading is called compile time polymorphism
method overriding is  called run time polymorpism

JAVA CLASS #10
Interface in java
 we cannot create the object ot interface
 interface has no method body---- only method decleration
 no static methods are allowed in interface
 interface variables are static and final by default
 interface to interface we use "extends" keywork
after JDK 1.8 we can create method body in interface by using default keywork "default"
over riding is possiable with static method but over 

a class cannot have multipul perents in java but with the help of interface we can have multipal parents
multipul inharetence with class to class is not allowed in java with class to interface
interface is used to define methods which dont have method body 
we only delare methods in interface mehods shold not have body

we use "implements" keyword inorder to create parent child relationship bw child class and perent interface
we define methods in interface and then copy same methods and define full methods in child class this is
also called full over ride

Method in Interface  >>>>> public void test(); only declare method 
Method in class >>>>>>>>>>>public void test(){
system.prilbtxxx();
}

we use , if we have multipul interfaces 
public class PakHospital implements USinterface,UKInterface  
webdriver is an interface in selenium
 as we know object of an iterface cannot be create 
  WebDriver driver = new WebDriver();  <<<<not correct>>>>>
  WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();<<<<<correct way >>>>>>>>>
======================================================================================
JAVA CLASS #11 String manipulation

String is a collection of characters
Trim method/function is used to cut string from the corners
//Trim method
       String s1 = "    hellow abdul     ";
       System.out.println(s1.trim());


remove space bw string we use .replace method
  
       String s2= "Hellow  Worldd";
       System.out.println(s2.replace(" ",""));

Sub string == trim from ay given place of a string 

       String str1 = "your user id is abduljan";
       System.out.println(str1.substring(9,str.length()))

String comperasion
 String str11 = " The rain has started here";
       String str12 = " The rain has started here";
       System.out.println(str11.equals(str12));

equal to equal to === generaly we use for integers

SPLIT FUNCTION
  String lang = "java - python-donet=ruby";
             lang.split("_");  
      String lolo[] = lang.split("-");
       System.out.println(lolo[1]);
  system will pring second valude which is "python". 

to print all values
for(int i=0; i<lang.length();i++) {
    	   System.out.println(lolo[i]);

Immutable objects 

string buffer is muttale but String is not mutable 

	String slm="Selenium";//muineleS
		   int lng = slm.length();
		   
		   String rev="";
		   
		for(int k=lng-1;k>=0;k--) {
			
			rev=rev+slm.charAt(k);
				
		}
				
		System.out.println("mutable :"+rev);
===================================================================================]
CLASS VIDEO #12 EXCEPTION HANDLING 
try {
			int i =9/0;	
			
		}catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
exception is the problem within your code
error means problem with the syntex
exception only be caught by exception and error only b caught by error 
Exception is a class
Throwable is a class
Error is a class ( Throwable is the supper class of Exception and Error	

Throws keyword is for method channing purpose. when you have to pass exception from one 
method to another one
Throw keyword we use when we delberatly want exception
Try cach is used for excepton handling  with proper reporting

This keyword. we use this keyword inorder to initilize class variables with the help 
on constractor variables 

super keyworkd is used to call the constractor of parent class
HashMap

For each loop is used in case of arry list
================================================================================================
Selenium sessions 
Selenium Class #1

Maven is a build tool which automatically genertes dependency for selenium 
maven is a dependency management tool
jar files/ liberaries are bundled togater and availabe at maven centeralized repository

WebDriver is an interface where different methods only defined we create driver classes 
and implemetns those methods
we cannot create an object of interface
we can create only reference object 
ChromeDriver is the child of WebDriver interface

Selenium Class #2
Navigation concept
Navigate has more features then get... like>>>>>>>>>> navigate.back/navigate.forward/refresh
Get method waits for the page to be loaded but Navigate method doesnot wait for page to be load 
driver.manage.window.fullscreen >>>>>> to fit to your screen
webdriver methods

 check debugger at 46min of video
driver.close and driver.quit >>>>>>>.check respectie screenshot
quit means close all open windows/sessions
close mean close only current window

could not test debuger propertly. try again


=====================================================================
Selenium Class #3
WebElements/webobjects/page objects / web components(button,link,image,etc
system.setproperty (chromedriver.exe) is provided by google 

There are 8 locators
 1.id 2 name 3 clasname 4 linktaxt 5 partial linktext  6.xpath 7.css selector  
HTML DOM is 
<input is HTML tag
id is webelemnt attribute 
WebElement is an interface
xpath (extended path) is not an attribute/property,  Xpath is 
address of that element 
HTML is used to design websies. its for web development 
all the links are represented by a tag (ankar tag)

==================================================================
Selenium Class #4
Select tag should be there 
whenever we create select class object we have to pass Web Element of that
particular dropdown like
      WebElement month = driver.findelement(By.id("month")))
      Select slect = new Select(month);
      slect.selectyby.....

need to pratice alot on this class

=============================================================

Selenium Class #5  (missing vido but is about action class)

Actions Class
http://mrbool.com/ 
with actions class we have to use .build().perform(); at the end

drag n drop is only for webelements  
https://jqueryui.com/
frame is a small section of a page where other elements are present 
w3c standered dont recomend frames 
======================================================================
Selenium Class #6

(java script alert, browser popups)
Windo PoP or model dialouge up handler
Alert is an intface we need to switch  to alert dailog box
driver.swithcTo().alert();
we can create alert reference 

file upload error pop up
https://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu/ex/fup.html
WebElement fileupload=driver.findElement
type = file should be there in order to select file from window
if type=file attribute is not there in HTML DOM THEN sendkyes method will not work

authentication popup
http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth
we have to pass username and password in url lik
http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth

Browser Window pop up
http://www.popuptest.com/goodpopups.html
we need window id inorder to switch from one window to another window 
to get window id we have one method called getwindowhandeles();
this getwindowhandles method returns set object
set is coming from java not from selenium
set values must be uniques not like list where values can be unieque
we will use iterator to get orderless value
===============================================================
SELENIUM CLASS #7 need to do it again 
clander drowpdowns
tr in xml dom means rows
driver.findelements will return a list of webelements

==================================================================
SELENIUM CLASS #8
Element verification 
for webelements we have 3 methods
isenabled
isselected
is displayed
 
for checkbox we have only one method
is selected
WebDriverManger developed by bonigarica 

Headless testing
// no browser is getting launched 
	// testing happens behind the scene
	//executon is faster
	
We need to use a class
ChromeOptions cmop = new ChromeOptions();

PhantomJS scriptable Headless Browesr 
htmlunit driver maven is also for headless broswer testing 

ChromeOptions co = new ChromeOptions();
		
			co.addArguments("--start-maximized");
			co.addArguments("--ignore-certificate-error");
		    co.addArguments("--disable-pupup-blocking");
		    co.addArguments("--incognito");
====================================================================
SELENIUM CLASS #9
hashmap in selenium
www.londonfreelance.org
frame method is overloaded
to move to frame we use
driver.swithcto().frame();
returning from frame to page we use
driver.swithcto().defaultcontent();
===================================================================

SELENIUM CLASS #10 
CONFIG. PROPERTIES
is kind of globle veriable 
in properties we put # for comments
