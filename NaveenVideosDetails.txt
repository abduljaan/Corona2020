Java class #7
Method overloading, Static none static class objects, Heap memory, Garbage collector


Java Class #8
constructor, constructor with or without parameters,
if we dont create constructor JVM creates a hidden constructor by default 
when ever we create an object the construtor of that particular class will be called
this.class variable = local variable 


Java Class #9 

incapsolation means we declared some variable private in nature and access them with the help of public methods
// to create getter and setter methos righ click on sourc and select generate getter setter method
class objects

when a parent class and a child class have seprate seprate methods with same name same parameter is called method overriding 
it comes in to the picture at the time to inharitance

method overloding>> with in the same class we create different methods with same name but perametter and numbers are different

method orverloading and method overriding are the concipt of polymarphysenm 
poly means many and marhpsm means forms

polymorphism = method overloading+methodoverriding
method overloading is called compile time polymorphism
method overriding is  called run time polymorpism

JAVA CLASS #10
Interface in java
 we cannot create the object ot interface
 interface has no method body---- only method decleration
 no static methods are allowed in interface
 interface variables are static and final by default
 interface to interface we use "extends" keywork
after JDK 1.8 we can create method body in interface by using default keywork "default"
over riding is possiable with static method but over 

a class cannot have multipul perents in java but with the help of interface we can have multipal parents
multipul inharetence with class to class is not allowed in java with class to interface
interface is used to define methods which dont have method body 
we only delare methods in interface mehods shold not have body

we use "implements" keyword inorder to create parent child relationship bw child class and perent interface
we define methods in interface and then copy same methods and define full methods in child class this is
also called full over ride

Method in Interface  >>>>> public void test(); only declare method 
Method in class >>>>>>>>>>>public void test(){
system.prilbtxxx();
}

we use , if we have multipul interfaces 
public class PakHospital implements USinterface,UKInterface  
webdriver is an interface in selenium
 as we know object of an iterface cannot be create 
  WebDriver driver = new WebDriver();  <<<<not correct>>>>>
  WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();<<<<<correct way >>>>>>>>>

JAVA CLASS #11 String manipulation

String is a collection of characters
Trim method/function is used to cut string from the corners
//Trim method
       String s1 = "    hellow abdul     ";
       System.out.println(s1.trim());


remove space bw string we use .replace method
  
       String s2= "Hellow  Worldd";
       System.out.println(s2.replace(" ",""));

Sub string == trim from ay given place of a string 

       String str1 = "your user id is abduljan";
       System.out.println(str1.substring(9,str.length()))

String comperasion
 String str11 = " The rain has started here";
       String str12 = " The rain has started here";
       System.out.println(str11.equals(str12));

equal to equal to === generaly we use for integers

SPLIT FUNCTION
  String lang = "java - python-donet=ruby";
             lang.split("_");  
      String lolo[] = lang.split("-");
       System.out.println(lolo[1]);
  system will pring second valude which is "python". 

to print all values
for(int i=0; i<lang.length();i++) {
    	   System.out.println(lolo[i]);

Immutable objects 

string buffer is muttale but String is not mutable 

	String slm="Selenium";//muineleS
		   int lng = slm.length();
		   
		   String rev="";
		   
		for(int k=lng-1;k>=0;k--) {
			
			rev=rev+slm.charAt(k);
				
		}
				
		System.out.println("mutable :"+rev);

CLASS VIDEO #12 EXCEPTION HANDLING 
try {
			int i =9/0;	
			
		}catch(Exception e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
exception is the problem within your code
error means problem with the syntex
exception only be caught by exception and error only b caught by error 
Exception is a class
Throwable is a class
Error is a class ( Throwable is the supper class of Exception and Error	

Throws keyword is for method channing purpose. when you have to pass exception from one 
method to another one
Throw keyword we use when we delberatly want exception
Try cach is used for excepton handling  with proper reporting

This keyword. we use this keyword inorder to initilize class variables with the help 
on constractor variables 

super keyworkd is used to call the constractor of parent class
HashMap

For each loop is used in case of arry list
